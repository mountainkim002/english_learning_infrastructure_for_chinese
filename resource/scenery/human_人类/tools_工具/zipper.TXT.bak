zipper

	The zipper is a wonderful invention.How did people ever live without zipper? They are very common,so we forget that they are wonderful. They are very strong, but they open and close very easily. They come in many colors and size.
	In the 1890s, people in the United States wore high shoes with a long row of buttons. Clothes often had rows of buttons,too. People wished that clothes were easier to put on and take off.
	Whitcomb L. Judson, an engineer from the United States, invented the zipper in 1893. However, his zippers didn't stay closed very well.This was embarrassing, and people didn't buy many of them.
	Then, Dr. Gideon Sundback from Sweden solved this problem. His zipper stayed closed. A zipper has three parts.One, there are dozens of metal or plastic hooks, called teeth, in two rows. Two, these hooks ared fastened to two stripes of cloth. The cloth strips are flexible. They bend easily. Three, a fastener slides along and joins the hooks together. When it slides the other way, it takes the hooks apart.
