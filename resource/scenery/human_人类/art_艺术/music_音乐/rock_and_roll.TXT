rock and roll

  Rock and roll came from the blues and jazz during the 1950s.One of the first rock and roll songs was Bill haley's "Rock Around the Clock".One the first very famouse rock and roll singers was Elvis Presly.Others were Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry. Now, almost every country has many rock and roll bands and singers.Sometimes performers call their music by different names, like "rap" or "punk".They sing and play mixtures of rock and roll and talking or other sounds.Rap and punk both came from rock and roll music. Some fans who like rock music think the classical music is boring.Many fans play rock music very loudly. They forget about the people who enjoy soft music. Loud music can make these people nervous. Many fans also like to dance to rock and roll.
  When rock and roll was new, people had only records to play the music at home. After that people use cassette tapes and records.Now we listen to music on compact discs(often called CDs). Most modern bands and singers pay companies to make videos of their songs.With videos, fans can see the performers at the same time that they listen to the music. Making a recording and the video that goes with it is very expensive.
