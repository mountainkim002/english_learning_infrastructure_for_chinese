Leisure Time

	John works 45 hours a week. It takes him an hour to travel to work every day. That means he spends 10 hours commuting each week. At home, John spends about 23 hours a week doing work around the house.Of cours, he needs to sleep, 56 hours a week, and prepare and eat meals,14 hours a week. So John has 20 hours of leisure.That is a typical amount of leisure time for someone in the United States.
	What do people do in their leisure time? Obviously watching TV is a popular free-time activity in many countries. Studies show that people are watching more TV today than they did 20 years ago. That's probably because there are many more TV channels today.People can choose programs from hundreds of TV channels.
	Computers are also changing the way people use their leisure time.Today people are spending more time doing things on their computers, surfing the internet is becoming another popular free-time activity. In fact, some employers are finding that workers are skipping lunch to surf the internet. More and more, people are mixing their work time and play time. They talk on the telephone while they are commuting to work. They read work papers while they are eating. They listen to music while they are studying. Maybe this is why people believe that they have less free time today.
