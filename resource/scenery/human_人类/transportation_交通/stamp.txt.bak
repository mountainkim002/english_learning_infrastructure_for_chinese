Stamp
	
	Before the invention of the postage stamp, it was difficult to send a letter to another country. The sender paid for the letter to travel in his or her own country.Then the person in the other country paid for the rest of the trip.If a letter crossed several countries, the problem was worse. 
	Rowland Hill, a British teacher, had the idea of a postage stamp with glue on the back. The British post office made the 1st stamps in 1840. They were the Penny Black and the Twopence Blue. A person bought a stamp and put it on a letter. The post office delivered the letter. When people received letters, they didn't have to pay anything. The postage was prepaid. Postage stamps became popular in Great Britain immediately. Other countries started making their own postage stamps very quickly.
	There were still problems with international mai. Some countries did not want to accept letters with stamps from other countries. Finally, in 1874, a German organized the Universal Postal Union(UPU).
