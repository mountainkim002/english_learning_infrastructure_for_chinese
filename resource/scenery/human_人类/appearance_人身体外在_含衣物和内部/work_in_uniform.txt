uniform

	For some people, it's easy to get dressed for work. Pilots and police officers, for example, don't have to make decision about their work clothes.They wear uniforms to work every day.
	For many office workers,however,it is more difficult to choose clothes for work. They do not wear uniforms to the offices. Also many employees are changing their dress codes.They are allowing their employees to wear casual clothes to work.
	The change to casual work clothes began in the 1990s. At first, many companies in the United States allowed employees to wear casual clothes on one day of the week--Friday. Friday became "Casual Friday" or "Dress-down Friday". Today, however, many companies are allowing their employees to wear casual clothes every day of the week.
	Why are companies allowing their employees to wear casual clothes? Some studies show that people are more productive when they are wearing comfortable clothes. Employees also like the casual dress code because they don't need to buy special clothes for work. They can save money this way.
	Unfortunately, a casual dress code can also cause problems.Sometimes employees dress too casually. They think they can wear anything. Many companies have rules about casual clothes. They list the kind of clothes that are not business-casual clothes. Blue jeans, sandals and sportwear are examples of clothes that are usually too casual for the office.
