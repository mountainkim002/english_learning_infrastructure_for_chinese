Maori in New Zealand
 
	Polynesians  live on islands in the Pacific Ocean. The Maori are Polynesians, and they live at the southern end of Polynesia in New Zealand.
	The Maori arrived in New Zealand from other Polynesian islands over 1000 years ago. They were the first people to live in New Zealand.
	In the late 18th century, Europeans came to live in New Zealand. At that time, there were perphaps 250,000 Maori in New Zealand. Over the next 100 years, wars and disease killed many Maori. By the end of the 19th century, there were only about 40000 Maori left. During the 19th century, the Maori also lost much of their land to the Europeans. Many Maori were afraid that they might lose their traditions and language. But this did not happen.
