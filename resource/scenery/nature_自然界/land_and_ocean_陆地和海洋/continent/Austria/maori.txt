Maori in New Zealand
 
	Polynesians  live on islands in the Pacific Ocean. The Maori are Polynesians, and they live at the southern end of Polynesia in New Zealand.
	The Maori arrived in New Zealand from other Polynesian islands over 1000 years ago. They were the first people to live in New Zealand.
	In the late 18th century, Europeans came to live in New Zealand. At that time, there were perphaps 250,000 Maori in New Zealand. Over the next 100 years, wars and disease killed many Maori. By the end of the 19th century, there were only about 40000 Maori left. During the 19th century, the Maori also lost much of their land to the Europeans. Many Maori were afraid that they might lose their traditions and language. But this did not happen.
	Today the Maori population is increasing. There are about 500,000 Maori in New Zealand. Most live like other New Zealanders.But they are keeping the Maori language and traditions alive. There are now Maori radio and television stations. Many schools teach in the Maori language. Nearly one half of Maori languages speakers are 25 years old or younger.
	Maori culture is also alive and well. At the center of the Maori culture is the "marae". This is special place for ceremonies and meetings. Today the number of marae in the New Zealand is increasing. Many of the new marae are in the cities. Now people in the cities can meet and learn about their Maori traditions. Today most New Zealand cities have yearly Maori festivals. Among the festival activities are competitions in speaking, dancing and singing. Children practice for month.Then all the Maori in the area arrive to watch the competitions and see who wins.
	Today the Maori live a comfortable, modern life. However,they are not losing their traditions,because they are passing them on to their children.
