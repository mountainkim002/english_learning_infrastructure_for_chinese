Polynesian

	The Polynesians were probably the best explorers in the history of the world. They travelled thousand of kilometers across the Pacific Ocean in large boats called "double canoes". They could look the stars and know which way to go. They also understood the winds and the ocean currents. They made maps of the stars and the ocean currents. They made these maps out of sticks and shells.
	About 4000 years ago, a group of people lived in southern China. They were mixture of white,black and Mongol people. When the Chinese moved farther and farther into the south, these people needed to find safer homes.
	Slowly, these people left China in their double canoes and started toward the southeast. They took animals and plants with them. A group of people might arrive at an island and stay there until they had children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Then a few families might start travelling again. Some canoes went one way, and some another. It took hundreds of years for them to reach all of the islands in Polynesia. The double canoe is one of the greatest inventions in history. The Polynesians were among the greatest sailors in history.They understood how to sail by the stars and use the winds and ocean currents. This made them great explorers.
